Welcome to my home page! My name is Catherine Chen; I am a Ph.D. Candidate at the Department of Communication at Stanford University, advised by Professor Jon Krosnick. I am currently on the academic job market, seeking an assistant professor position set to commence in the fall of 2024.</p>

<p>Broadly, my research interests revolve around <strong>understanding the antecedents, structure, and consequences of political attitudes among Americans</strong>. Specifically, my work focuses on examining <strong>people’s attitudes toward science, climate change, and vaccines</strong>. Rather than adopting a strictly methods-based approach, I take a <strong>problem-oriented</strong> approach to research. My methodological toolkit encompasses a range of techniques, including surveys, lab and field experiments, quasi-experiments, as well as computationally intensive methods like digital trace data analysis and automated text analysis.</p>

<p>Within this framework, I have been pursuing three interconnected research questions.</p>
<ul>
  <li>What are the origins, underlying structure, and implications of <strong>Americans’ attitudes toward global warming</strong>?</li>
  <li>What are the factors that contribute to the <strong>partisan divide in attitudes toward science</strong> in the United States, and how to bridge this gap?</li>
  <li>What are the <strong>cultural and political factors</strong> that shape public attitudes toward science, climate change, and vaccines across diverse regions and demographic groups?</li>
</ul>

<p>My research findings have been disseminated through prestigious peer-reviewed journals such as <em>Climate Change</em> and <em>Health Psychology</em>. My research has received support from various institutions, including the Stanford Center for Democracy (SCAD), the Stanford Institute for Research in the Social Sciences (IRiSS), and the Rapoport Family Foundation. I have been honored to hold positions such as the Melville J. Jacoby Fellow and the SAP Fellow under the Stanford Graduate Fellowship. Currently, I am engaged in my work as a Dissertation Fellow at IRiSS.</p>

<p>Outside academia, I have worked as a journalism intern at the Agence France-Presse (AFP) and a public relations intern at Sina Corps. I was born and raised in Dalian, China and spent some time in both Hong Kong and Australia. I am a cat lover and also find joy in exploring nature!</p>
