COMM 105S Public Understanding of Science, Stanford University

This course is about the interrelationship between science and the public, where "science" is understood in a broad way including both social and natural sciences. It examines how communication about science (in classrooms, in the news media, etc.) influences how the public thinks and acts when it comes to scientific issues. This course explores public perceptions, representations, and assessments of science by drawing together studies from communication, psychology, political science, and environmental science.
